# PART II:
Adding Podcasts to the APP
## GOALS:
- Install the Barstool React Player
- Parse the Pardon My Take RSS feed https://mcsorleys.barstoolsports.com/feed/pardon-my-take
- Play Latest Episodes from the RSS feed on a sticky player on the bottom of the page
- Load a table view of the next 20 episodes so that it doesn't disrupt the story feed visually
- Clicking on another episode changes the player
