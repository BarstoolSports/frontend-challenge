I added scss to the project - there is a bug in Next 13 that breaks with the sass loader, there is a work around! Upgrade your node version to 16.

## Set up
`node -v` figure out which version of node you're on, if < 16 you'll need to do this:
`nvm install 16`
`nvm use 16`, then run a `node-v` to make sure you're up to date with 16 ðŸ«¡
`npm install`

## running it
`npm run dev`
